# React_04 - Task List App

This is a simple React application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed by clicking on them, and remove them using a delete button. The project is styled using Bootstrap 5.

## Features

- ✅ Add a new task by typing in the input and clicking "Add Task".
- 🗑️ Delete a task using the delete button.
- 🟢 Mark a task as complete by clicking on the task text (to be improved in the future).
- 💡 Clean and responsive UI with Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used

- React with functional components and Hooks
- Bootstrap 5
- Vite (build tool)
